# Spec File Guidelines

When editing `thinking/spec.md`:

- The content should represent the **final intended outcome** of the project.
- Do **not** include phased implementation statements like:
  - "optional in v1"
  - "defer for v1"
  - "for v1"
  - "optional for v1"
  - Similar versioning qualifiers
- Write the spec as if describing the complete, final system.
- Implementation strategy and phasing should be tracked elsewhere (e.g., issue tracking), not in the spec.

The spec is a vision document, not an implementation roadmap.
